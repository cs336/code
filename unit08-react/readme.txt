This is an implementation of the (old) Facebook ReactJS tutorial - the comment list:

     https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden/08react/backup/Tutorial_React.html
     (formerly at https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)

It will serve as the basis for the application built in the "Application" section of the course.
