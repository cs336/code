This is a refactored implementation of the (old) Facebook ReactJS tutorial - the comment list:

     (formerly at https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)

This application is upgraded to deploy to Heroku based on the specification in lab exercise 11 (https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden/11heroku/lab.html). For the running app, see https://comments-kvlinden.herokuapp.com/.
